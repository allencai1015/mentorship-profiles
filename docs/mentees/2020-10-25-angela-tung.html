  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I love meeting new people and making new friends. I would say that I am ambiverted! I am always open to listening and talking with friends. I am hardworking, but can also get stressed easily from time to time which makes me tend to feed off of others motivation to get through. I am pretty easy going and love to crack jokes. In my free time, I love going out and getting food with anyone and trying new things. If you read all this, thank you, you get some fried rice. :)</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I am looking into the health sciences field. I want to become a biology major and hopefully go on a premed track.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I love playing tennis and going out to get food. I love to eat sushi and hot pot but I am also open to trying other cuisines as well. I would always be down to just catch up and talk. I love listening to calm, vibey music. Some artists I love listening to is Keshi, Khalid, NIKI, Daniel Caesar, and RINI. I am open to trying new hobbies and activites anytime. Mr.Wish is one of my favorite places to get a drink. Not to get boba, but indeed their Passionfruit Fiber Jelly Tea is a perfection.</p>

<h3 id="looking-for">Looking For</h3>

<p>I am looking for a mentor that is willing to guide me in my path to finding my major. But I am also just looking for a friend and someone to chat with and look up to.</p>
