  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is Viwing Zheng. You can just refer to me as Vi. I am a third year studying Computer Science, and I am currently the President of SASE Drexel. My favorite animal is the panda, and a fun fact is that I can say “Imagine pandas eating cherry tomatoes” in at least 5 different languages. I am a very friendly person, and I hope to become very good friends with my mentee. On my free time, I enjoy eating, cooking (I can cook for you!), playing the ukulele, and many more. My hobbies tend to change over time because I like to try out new things! We can try new things together!</p>

<h3 id="previous-work-experience">Previous Work Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vanguard IT Developer</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>In the future, I wish to become someone in a C-level position in a company preferably started by me. I want to live and fight for something that I believe in and find joy in doing. This goal is super far down the line, but I hope to achieve it one day! But in terms of a short term goal, I want to rack up technical skills during coop (which is spring-summer for me), and when I am released to society after graduation, I can be of help, and hopefully be a manager position.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>I am interested in food (low-key a foodie) and cooking, so I can cook my mentee food. I also enjoy to watch YouTube videos and anime on my free time. I sometimes also do math for fun haha. Also, I am trying to dabble into more personal projects. I have a lot of interests, but one that I’m trying to get into is extreme sports, so I want to go sky diving, paragliding, etc. I think that physical excursions are always fun!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to expect from me</h3>

<p>I think my relationship will be a combination of the academic, professional, and emotional. I am looking for a mentee that is friendly and kind. I don’t have a ideal mentee type, but I like someone who is willing to step out of their comfort zones, and maybe I can drag them out if anything.</p>
