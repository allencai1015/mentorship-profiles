  <h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>Wassup my name is Angel and I’m from the Bay Area in California. I tend to be more on the introverted side. Usually in unfamiliar situations, I tend to not speak up as much but as you get to know me, you’ll realize that I talk a lot more. I love meeting new people and getting to know them. My friends describe me as caring and mellow except for when I’m ranting about random stuff; then I’m hotheaded.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>

<p>I think my immediate career goal is to get a stable job at some tech company as an engineer. In the future, I think I would like to move more into the management and business side. After having a sufficient amount of savings/income, I would eventually like to switch over to a startup. The environment in a big corporate company versus a startup is very different and I would like to try out the startup experience. It seems to be a popular pathway for many people in the Silicon Valley.</p>

<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>

<p>Some of my interests include photography and anything that has to do with food. I enjoy going out for food with friends as well as cooking and trying new recipes at home. I love going on walks or hikes and sometimes I bring my camera with me just for fun. Since we can’t go out as often these days, you can often find me on Discord gaming with friends (Valorant, Genshin, Among Us, Jackbox, etc.). I’m open to trying new games out although I’m really bad at them.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-me">What to expect from me</h3>

<p>As opposed to a very formal mentor/mentee relationship, I envision my relationship with my mentee to be one like very close friends. I want to become close friends with my mentee and be a person that my mentee can always turn to no matter what problems may be bothering them.</p>
