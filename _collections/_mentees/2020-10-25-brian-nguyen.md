### About

I would describe myself as an ambitious person with many different interests and goals in mind. I have physical, social, and academic goals that I hope to achieve by the end of my college career, with the support of friends and family.

### Career Goals

My short-term goal is to find a research opportunity to strengthen my resume for when I apply to co-ops, and I hope to join several different student organizations and eventually work my way up to different leadership/board positions to gain more leadership experience.

### Looking For

I'm looking for someone who's friendly, willing to go out and do some fun things, and can provide their experience and guidance for me as I progress throughout my college years. In general, I am compatible with most other people!
