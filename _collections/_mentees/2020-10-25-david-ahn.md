### About

I'm a sophomore majoring in CS. I consider myself a bit of an introvert but I really like talking about topics that interest me. I could've tried to mentor this year but I'm not very confident that my advice will be of any use to any freshman, so I decided that I would just be a mentee again.

### Career Goals

Since I'm a computer science major, I want to either work in some sort of software development or go into the the video game industry as my concentration is in game programming and development.

### Interests

I like video games, comics, anime, professional wrestling and food.

### Looking For

Mainly a professional and academic mentor but I'm not all too picky.
