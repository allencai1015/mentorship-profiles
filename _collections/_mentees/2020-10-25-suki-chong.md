### About

I'm pretty laidback and easygoing for the most part. I'm pretty introverted, but I am friendly when people get to know me. 

### Career Goals

I am interested in computer science, but I do not really have a particular field in mind. So far, I am leaning towards web development and/or software engineering.

### Interests

I like watching tiktoks and listening to music (alternative/indie) in my free time. I have picked up skateboarding recently, and I am also interested in animation. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a friend that I can come to if I need help with things at Drexel.
