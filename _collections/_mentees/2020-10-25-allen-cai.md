about: Myers Briggs - ISFJ. I'm pretty introverted (grew up with a speech impediment), but if I'm with people I'm comfortable with I can be super energetic and talkative. I'm a perfectionist, and so even though I procrastinate, I still try hard at everything I do. I'd consider myself smart and mature, and when my friends are having crises I'm usually the one that steps in and calms them down. # "Briefly describe yourself"

### About

Myers Briggs: ISFJ. I'm pretty introverted (grew up with a speech impediment), but if I'm with people I'm comfortable with I can be super energetic and talkative. I'm a perfectionist, and so even though I procrastinate, I still try hard at everything I do. I'd consider myself smart and mature, and when my friends are having crises I'm usually the one that steps in and calms them down.

### Career Goals

I'm still not sure what exactly I want to do, but I want a stable job with a decent salary and am an introvert, so I'm trying out Data Science/CS stuff for now. Based on my experience working as a gymnastics coach, I think I'd enjoy a job as a teacher/professor/coach/tutor, but none of those pay very well so...

### Interests

I did gymnastics and played violin for 10 years each. I work out regularly and like going for walks outdoors and climbing trees. I'm into games of all kinds (Egyptian Rat Screw, Hearthstone, Shadowverse, League, Smash Bros, Among Us, Genshin Impact etc.). I read a lot of manga and watch anime (https://myanimelist.net/animelist/starlight4972). I love food in general, and will try almost any food I get a chance to eat.

### Looking For

Ideally, I'd like to have a mentor with the same major who could give me advice about the specific classes/professors I should look out for and could help me with Data Science work. However, I realize that's unlikely simply due to how few Data Science majors there are at Drexel. In general though, I'd like to have a mentor that shares a few interests with me, and who in general I could just have a fun time with. Being able to help with school/co-op stuff would be really nice, but not required.
