### About

I’m a pretty chill person. I like to have fun, go out and try new things but I also take school seriously; trying hard to keep that work-life balance!

### Previous Work Experience
- Architectural/Mechanical Co-op at Philadelphia International Airport
- Architectural/Mechanical Intern at NIST

### Career Goals

My long term career goal is obtain a job after graduation which involves tasks that incorporate sustainability in designing HVAC systems and the analysis of IAQ on buildings. One of my short term career goals is to improve on my networking and communication skills.

### Interests

I enjoys arts & crafts, listening to music, photography and trying out new recipes.

### What to expect from me

I hope that the relationship I have with my mentee is more casual and non-formal, with open communication as I hope to simply be just another addition to their growing support system.
