### About

I am someone who continuously looks for new avenues towards self-improvement. I may appear to be really shy at first, but once you get to know me, I naturally start to show my more fun, carefree side. I am ambitious, reliable, and a little silly here and there.

### Career Goals

I want to work in business (not really sure exactly what yet). One of my biggest career goals is to find a job that incorporates my passions and hopefully pays well too.

### Interests

Basketball, videography, photography, writing, video games, board games, martial arts, music, table tennis, watching television, youtube, weight training, squash, biking. I am very much open to trying anything.

### What to expect from me

I see it as being very informal. I don't want our relationship to feel forced upon. Also, I may not be the best "professional" mentor in terms of finding a co-op since I myself have yet to experience one (especially anything in science/engineering related). I can certainly help in some aspects, but I see myself more has a resource for other things, as well as, a really supportive friend.
